## Fluent & Persisting Models

### Fluent
Fluent is Vaporâ€™s ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool. It serves as an abstraction layer between the Vapor application and the database, simplifying database interactions. Using an ORM like Fluent offers numerous advantages:

- **Ease of Interaction**: No need to directly use the database! Traditional direct interactions require database queries as strings, which lack type-safety and are cumbersome in Swift.
``` swift
// Traditional query as a string
let queryString = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1"
// Fluent "Swifty" way
User.query(on: db).filter(\.$id == 1).all()
```
  
- **Flexibility**: Fluent supports multiple database engines, even within the same application. This eliminates the need to write queries manually, facilitating a more "Swifty" interaction with models.
``` swift
// Fluent "Swifty" way
User.query(on: db).filter(\.$id == 1).all()
```
  
- **Models**: These are Swift representations of your data and play a pivotal role in Fluent. Models represent objects, such as user profiles, that you store and retrieve from your database. Fluent ensures type-safety by returning and using these models during database interactions.
``` swift
final class User: Model {
    static let schema = "users"
    @ID var id: UUID?
    @Field(key: "name") var name: String
}
```
  
- **Advanced Features in Fluent 4**:
  - **@ID**: This property wrapper designates a property as the table ID. It's crucial for queries, especially when locating models. By default, the ID should be a UUID and named `id`.
    
  - **@Field**: Represents a generic column in the database. Fluent uses this for query operations with filters. It allows for updating individual fields in a model and selecting specific fields from the database. For non-optional properties, always use @Field. For optional properties, opt for @OptionalField.
    
- **Migrations**: For storing a model in the database, its corresponding table needs to be created. Fluent accomplishes this using migrations. Migrations ensure dependable, testable, and consistent modifications to your database. They're essential for crafting a database schema for your models, seeding data, or altering saved models.
``` swift
struct CreateUser: Migration {
    func prepare(on database: Database) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        return database.schema("users")
            .id()
            .field("name", .string, .required)
            .create()
    }

    func revert(on database: Database) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        return database.schema("users").delete()
    }
}
```
